<p>My name is Daniel and I will be turning thirteen soon. Becoming a
  teenage boy means you get to do fun stuff like hunting. To be an
  effective and safe hunter, I must first learn the dos and don’ts
  of the craft. </p>
<p>I must first understand how to properly handle hunting equipment.
  A rifle and a crossbow will be my weapon of choice. Before I can
  get a rifle, I have to take a class on safety which is completed
  over the internet. </p>
<p>It took me about one week to finish the online safety course. Once
  the class was completed, I took a test and passed it on the first
  try. After passing the test with flying colors, grandfather and
  I visited the gun shop to pick </p>
<p>out a rifle. I was so excited to see all those guns on display.
  Some guns were cheap and some were very expensive. Finding
  the right fit for me was going to be harder than I thought.
  I wanted a 308-caliber rifle but grandfather </p>
<p>said that was too big for me and it was also very expensive.
  “A more appropriate size caliber for you will be a .22.” grandfather
  said. “A .22 is good for you to practice with” he added.
  We did not get a gun </p>
<p>the first day we went to the gun shop, or the second or third time.
  It took weeks before we finally decided on a rifle. Grandfather
  bought it off one of his friends. It was a used .22 rifle in
  good condition. </p>
<p>It takes both .22 long and short rounds. Hunting season was 8
  months away so I had lots of time to practice shooting. Where
  I live people mostly hunt turkey, ducks, moose and deer;
  There is a hunting season for each one. </p>
<p>Even though you can hunt turkey and ducks with a .22 caliber
  rifle, it is not very practical to do so. A shotgun is best
  for bird hunting. It is near impossible to bring down a giant
  moose with a .22 caliber rifle. </p>
<p>Deer will be our preferred quarry during hunting season. Before
  the hunting season opened, I practice shooting at the gun range
  every week. Grandfather was there to make sure I practice good
  safety habits; I had to get it right or he </p>
<p>was not going to take me hunting with him. So, I practiced diligently.
  After months of practice, hunting season was finally upon us. To
  legally hunt we need to buy a license from the Fish and Game
  authorities. The license comes in</p>
<p>two categories, Guns and Bow and arrows. Bow season comes first so
  grandfather opted for a Bow license. Up to now I have been practicing
  with my rifle so it came as a surprise when grandfather chose Bow hunting.</p>
<p> My eyes lit up when grandfather turned to me and said “We will be
  getting you a crossbow, kid!”. It wasn’t long before the crossbow
  arrived and I immediately started practicing using it. The safety
  protocols of a crossbow are similar to</p>
<p>using a rifle, so there was not much more I needed to know.
  The first days of hunting was spent gathering intel on the deer.
  We drove around to different spots and observed the foraging
  habits of the intended prey. </p>
<p>We scouted different hunting locations for hunting advantages like
  cover, wind direction and a safe shooting angle. The last thing you
  want to do is to shoot in the direction of places nearby that may
  be occupied by people or farm animals. </p>
<p>Finally, the day came when I would get to take down a deer. I donned
  my hunting camouflage clothing and headed out to the woods with grandpa.
  We knew beforehand where the deer was going to be so we headed right to</p>
<p>the spot and waited quietly. After about 30 minutes I saw movement in
  the tree line. I whispered to grandpa “Over there.” It was a small
  deer, too small for us to take. Shortly after larger deer started to appear.</p>
<p>“Stay low.” Grandpa whispered. I laid on my stomach moving slowly and deliberately.
  I spotted my primary target; it was a female deer about 50 yards away.
  Slowly worked my way into position I armed the crossbow with a flathead arrow.</p>
<p>Aiming for the chest cavity just above the shoulder, the shot should rupture
  the heart or lung stopping the Animal in its tracks; easier said than done.
  I was nervous, my heart began to beat rapidly. Going through simple breathing
  exercises</p>
<p> helps to calm me down. The animal turned, setting up a clear shot at the
  heart. I hesitated for a split second. The window of opportunity for a
  clean shot began to diminish as the creature continued to move.
  An urgency took </p>
<p>control of me and I pulled the trigger. Whack! The thump of the arrow
  meeting its target echoed through the forest. The Deer leaped from
  its standing position and ran off.” Did I miss?” I asked grandfather.
  “I Don’t know, let’s go check.”</p>
<p>As we came closer to the place where the deer stood, we could see blood
  and lots of it. Following the trail of blood, we found the deer laying
  in a bush, it was still alive. Grandfather turned to me and said,</p>
<p>“One more arrow should do the trick!” I knocked another flathead and
  took aim at the heart. From this distance I couldn’t miss and I didn’t.
  it was over, the deer didn’t even move as the arrow sliced clear through to</p>
<p>the other side of the beast and pierced the earth besides. It weighed about
  150 lbs. After removing the innards, the weight dropped to 130 lbs. which made
  it a little bit easier to drag out of the forest to the van. </p>
<p>I was overcome with joy after my first successful hunt. I called my dad
  to tell him all about it. The next day, I help grandfather skin and cut
  up the deer meat; It smelled terrible but I didn’t mind. Most of the meat</p>
<p>was placed into a storage freezer and will be consumed throughout the
  winter month. We cooked some of the meat for lunch and dinner that day.
  The whole experience made me happy but there was one thing left to do.</p>
<p>We did not find the first arrow I used. Since each arrow cost a fair
  amount of money it was imperative, we return to the hunting spot
  to look for it. Eventually I found the arrow imbedded deep within
  a tree twenty feet</p>
<p>from where the deer was standing. “Wow, that crossbow is really powerful
  ” I said to grandfather. It took some effort to free the arrow from the tree.
  "very impressive."grandpa muttered. After retrieveing the arrow we returned home. 
  Grandfather is already planning another hunt and I
  cannot wait!</p>
